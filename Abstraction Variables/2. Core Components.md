# 2.1 Abstraction Variables

## Definition and Representation

Abstraction variables in Maude are specialized variables used to temporarily bind problematic subterms during pattern matching operations. While they share the same basic implementation as regular variables, they are distinguished by their creation process and usage patterns.

The core representation includes:
- A variable index that identifies the abstraction variable
- Associated sort information inherited from `VariableTerm`
- Special handling through the `VariableAbstractionSubproblem` class

## Protected Variable Indices

Abstraction variables are implemented using a protected variable indexing scheme:
- Indices are allocated below `MAX_NR_PROTECTED_VARIABLES` (`10,000,000`)
- These protected indices ensure the variables are:
  - Cleared before matching operations
  - Preserved during substitution copying
  - Protected from garbage collection
  - Properly managed in local binding contexts

The protection mechanism is important for maintaining the integrity of temporary bindings during the matching process.

## Relationship to Regular Variables

Abstraction variables share infrastructure with regular variables but have several key differences:

1. Implementation Inheritance:
   - Both use the `VariableTerm` base class
   - Share basic variable properties (`sort`, `name`, `index`)
   - Use common variable manipulation mechanisms

2. Behavioral Differences:
   - Regular variables are used for standard pattern matching
   - Abstraction variables are specifically for handling special matching cases
   - Abstraction variables have local scope within their subproblem

3. Management:
   - Regular variables are managed through the general substitution mechanism
   - Abstraction variables require additional handling through `VariableAbstractionSubproblem`
   - Local bindings are tracked separately from global substitutions

4. Lifecycle:
   - Regular variables persist throughout term rewriting
   - Abstraction variables are temporary, existing only during specific matching operations
   - Their bindings are asserted and retracted as needed during problem solving

The relationship between abstraction and regular variables is designed to provide specialized matching capabilities while maintaining compatibility with Maude's general variable handling infrastructure.

# 2.2 Variable Abstraction Subproblem

## Class Structure and Responsibility

The `VariableAbstractionSubproblem` class inherits from the base `Subproblem` class and is specifically designed to handle variable abstraction during pattern matching. Its core structure consists of:

Key Components:
- `LhsAutomaton* abstractedPattern`: Manages the pattern being matched
- `int abstractionVariable`: Holds the index of the abstraction variable
- `LocalBinding* difference`: Tracks differences between local and global bindings
- `Subproblem* subproblem`: Handles nested subproblems
- `Substitution local`: Maintains local variable bindings

Primary Responsibilities:
- Managing temporary bindings during pattern matching
- Handling the abstraction of problematic subterms
- Coordinating between local and global substitution contexts
- Solving pattern matching problems involving abstracted variables

## Local vs Global Substitution Handling

The class implements a mechanism for managing the relationship between local and global substitutions:

1. Local Substitution Management:
```cpp
Substitution local(nrVariables);  // Local substitution space
local.copy(solution);            // Copy from global context
```

2. Difference Tracking:
- Maintains a `LocalBinding` object to track differences between local and global substitutions
- Uses assertion and retraction mechanisms to manage these differences:
```cpp
difference = local - solution;
if (difference != 0)
    difference->assert(solution);
```

3. Context Isolation:
- Local changes are isolated until explicitly committed
- Global context remains protected from temporary modifications
- Clean rollback mechanism for failed matching attempts

## Solving Mechanism

The solving process follows a systematic approach:

1. Initial Setup (`findFirst == true`):
```cpp
local.copy(solution);
DagNode* v = solution.value(abstractionVariable);
```

2. Pattern Matching:
- Attempts to match the abstracted pattern against the bound value
- Creates and manages any necessary subproblems
- Tracks binding differences between local and global contexts

3. Solution Management:
```cpp
if (difference != 0)
    difference->assert(solution);
if (subproblem == 0 || subproblem->solve(true, solution))
    return true;
```

4. Backtracking:
- Handles failed matches by retracting differences
- Cleans up resources and resets state
- Supports multiple solution finding through false `findFirst` parameter

5. Cleanup:
```cpp
if (difference != 0) {
    difference->retract(solution);
    delete difference;
    difference = 0;
}
```

This solving mechanism ensures proper handling of variable abstractions while maintaining the integrity of both local and global substitution contexts throughout the matching process.

# 2.3 Supporting Infrastructure

## Variable Management

The variable management infrastructure in Maude's abstraction variable system is built on the following components:

1. Variable Representation:
```cpp
class VariableTerm : public Term, public NamedEntity {
private:
    int index;
public:
    Sort* getSort() const;
    int getIndex() const;
    void setIndex(int indx);
};
```
- Variables are represented through the `VariableTerm` class which inherits from both `Term` and `NamedEntity`
- Each variable has a unique `index` and associated `sort` information
- The system maintains clear separation between regular and abstraction variables through index ranges

2. Variable Symbols:
```cpp
class VariableSymbol : public Symbol {
public:
    Term* makeTerm(const Vector<Term*>& args);
    DagNode* makeDagNode(const Vector<DagNode*>& args);
    Sort* getSort();
};
```
- Variable symbols provide the foundation for creating and manipulating variables
- Support for term creation and sort management
- Integration with the broader symbol system

## Substitution System

The substitution system manages variable bindings:

1. Core Substitution Management:
```cpp
class Substitution {
private:
    Vector<DagNode*> values;
    int copySize;
public:
    void bind(int index, DagNode* value);
    DagNode* value(int index) const;
    void copy(const Substitution& original);
};
```
- Maintains bindings between variables and their values
- Supports copying and modification of substitutions
- Handles both local and global binding contexts

2. Local Binding Support:
- Temporary bindings for abstraction variables
- Clean separation between local and global substitution spaces
- Efficient difference tracking between substitution contexts

## Pattern Matching Integration

The abstraction variable system integrates with pattern matching through:

1. Subproblem Management:
```cpp
class VariableAbstractionSubproblem : public Subproblem {
private:
    LhsAutomaton* abstractedPattern;
    int abstractionVariable;
    LocalBinding* difference;
    Subproblem* subproblem;
    Substitution local;
public:
    bool solve(bool findFirst, RewritingContext& solution);
};
```
- Specialized handling of abstraction variables during matching
- Integration with the broader pattern matching infrastructure
- Support for complex matching scenarios

2. DAG Node Integration:
```cpp
class VariableDagNode : public DagNode, public NamedEntity {
public:
    int getIndex() const;
    VariableSymbol* symbol() const;
    bool computeSolvedForm2(DagNode* rhs, UnificationContext& solution);
};
```
- DAG representation for variables in the matching process
- Support for unification and solved form computation
- Integration with the term rewriting infrastructure

3. Matching Context:
- Maintains state during pattern matching operations
- Handles special cases for abstraction variables
- Coordinates between different matching components
