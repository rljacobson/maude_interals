# Notes On Maude's Internal Implementation

This repository contains notes about the internal implementation of [the Maude term rewriting system](https://maude.cs.illinois.edu/wiki/The_Maude_System) from my attempts to understand it. Some of these notes are more speculative than others, and there are certainly many errorsâ€”though I don't know what they are.
