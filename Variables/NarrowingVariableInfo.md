# `NarrowingVariableInfo`

The `NarrowingVariableInfo` class is a component in the narrowing implementation, managing the state and mapping of variables during narrowing operations. This class maintains information about variables used in narrowing processes, providing a bridge between variable indices and their DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) representations. It is typically instantiated during the initialization of narrowing search states, such as when creating a `NarrowingSearchState` object. The class offers functionality to track and manage variable bindings throughout the narrowing process, facilitating unification and matching operations. `NarrowingVariableInfo` instances are commonly passed to various narrowing-related functions and classes, serving as a central repository for variable-related data and ensuring consistent variable handling across the narrowing system.
