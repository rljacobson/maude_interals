The `DagNode::reduce` method is the core function in Maude's term reduction system that reduces a DAG node to its canonical form by applying equations and built-in operations. It serves as the primary entry point for equational rewriting within the Maude interpreter.

## Purpose and Function

The `reduce` method transforms terms into their reduced (canonical) forms by repeatedly applying equations until no more reductions are possible. It takes a `RewritingContext` parameter that provides the rewriting environment and tracks statistics during reduction.

## How It's Used

The method is called extensively throughout Maude's rewriting system:

### In Symbol Implementations
Different symbol types call `reduce` on their arguments before applying their specific operations:

- **Equality symbols** reduce both operands before testing equality
- **CUI theory symbols** reduce arguments according to their evaluation strategy
- **S theory symbols** reduce their single argument in the eager strategy case
- **Free unary symbols** reduce their argument before applying discrimination nets

### In Narrowing Operations
During narrowing search, `reduce` is called on newly generated states to normalize them before folding checks. It's also used when expanding states during the narrowing process.

### In Meta-level Operations
The meta-interpreter uses `reduce` to normalize terms after rule applications and other operations.

### In Strategy Language
Strategy execution calls `reduce` on instantiated terms before further processing.

## Integration with RewritingContext

The method works closely with `RewritingContext`, which provides the reduction environment and tracks rewrite counts. The context's own `reduce()` method simply delegates to the root node's `reduce` method.

## Notes

The `reduce` method is fundamental to Maude's equational rewriting semantics, ensuring that terms are always in their canonical forms before further operations. It's called recursively during the reduction process and integrates with Maude's strategy system to control the order of evaluation.

## Key Differences Between `DagNode::reduce` and `Symbol::eqRewrite`

These functions play distinct but complementary roles in Maude's rewriting system:

1. **`DagNode::reduce`**  
   - Acts as the high-level orchestrator for term reduction  
   - Provides a uniform interface regardless of symbol type  
   - Delegates actual rewriting to `Symbol::eqRewrite`  
   - Called by system operations (narrowing, meta-level operations)  
   - Implemented as an inline non-virtual function in the base class  

2. **`Symbol::eqRewrite`**  
   - Handles low-level, symbol-specific rewriting  
   - Implements equation application and built-in operations  
   - Manages mathematical theories (free, CUI, successor, etc.)  
   - Processes evaluation strategies  
   - called from `DagNode::reduce`

### Control Flow  
The standard execution pattern follows:  
`reduce()` → symbol dispatch → `eqRewrite()` → argument reduction  

This hierarchy ensures clean separation between general reduction logic (`reduce`) and symbol-specific implementations (`eqRewrite`).
