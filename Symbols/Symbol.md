# Understanding `Symbols` in Maude

## What is a `Symbol`?

In the Maude interpreter, a `Symbol` is an abstract base class that represents operators in the algebraic specification. Looking at the codebase:

- `Symbol` serves as the foundation for all function and variable symbol definitions within the interpreter
- It inherits from multiple base classes including `RuleTable`, `NamedEntity`, `LineNumber`, `SortTable`, `SortConstraintTable`, `EquationTable`, `Strategy`, and `MemoTable`
- Each symbol has properties like a unique identifier, arity (number of arguments it takes), and sorting information

Symbols are essentially the building blocks of terms in Maude's term algebra. They represent both:

1. Function symbols (operators) that can be applied to arguments
2. Constants (operators with zero arguments)

## What Gets Parsed into a Symbol?

From the codebase, we can see that various language constructs get parsed into different types of `Symbol` objects:

1. **Operators declared in modules** become specialized symbols:
   - Standard operators become instances of `FreeSymbol`
   - Built-in equality operators become `EqualitySymbol` instances
   - String operations become `StringOpSymbol` instances

2. **Special identifiers**:
   - Quoted identifiers (like `'foo`) are represented by `QuotedIdentifierSymbol`
   - Loop constructs are handled by `LoopSymbol`

3. **Built-in data types**:
   - String literals are managed by `StringSymbol`
   - Numbers, booleans, and other primitive types have their own symbol classes

Each specialized symbol type implements specific behaviors for:

- Term creation (`makeTerm`)
- DAG node creation (`makeDagNode`)
- Pattern matching
- Sort computation
- Rewriting logic

The parser identifies these different constructs in Maude source code and creates the appropriate symbol objects, which then become part of the interpreter's internal representation of the specification.
